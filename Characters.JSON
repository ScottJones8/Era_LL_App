      "description": "*Last injected: around 0.5 Day(s) ago.\nAte food around 8 hour(s) ago.\n\n<i>Description (DM Interpretation)</i>\nShelby is a brash and boisterous young woman with a humble background. Her father ran a small whiskey distillery that he turned into the Thomas Whiskey Company. Her father ran the business in a tiny village, and used the whiskey to trade for other goods. Though her father was a stern man, he loved his daughters and taught them everything they know. Unfortunately her father died fairly young, being shot by raiders, leaving Shelby and her sisters to fend for themselves. Faye, the oldest sister, took control of the Thomas Whiskey Company. During this time Shelby had a “Disagreement” with Faye.\n\nHer dream is to bring order to Gaia via a democratic system of government. She facilitates this through the activities of the Blindy Peakers gang, where she, as the founder and leader, recruits anyone and everyone to do business.\n\nShe got the idea in a small town called Lilywood, after leaving her sisters and the family business. She is a kinder woman than she would like you to believe but quick to anger and fairly untrusting."
