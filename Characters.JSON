    "description": "Lilith fell sick at 3, her body would degenerate, consuming her cells. She was taken away from Cypher and experimented on for years by Base 9 who tried using her body's ability to *****************. After years of torture she was discarded by Base 9 as a failed experiment. Cypher took her body and hid her, He did what he could to fix her but her body was dying. Her health is sustained by consuming infected blood, she is constantly connected to hundreds of infected bodies all pumping blood into her. Cypher hopes to use the regenerative ability of the Alpha users to sustain this. In theory the Alpha parasites will regenerate as fast as they are consumed. \n\nLiliths condition ************************** perfectly, though this process is ********************** constant *********, otherwise all the parasites in her body will be ********************************\n\n"
